scAIDE
======================
> scAIDE is an unsupervised clustering framework for single-cell RNA-seq data. We revealed both putative and rare cell types in the 1.3 million neural cell dataset by global clustering. We obtained 64 clusters within 30 minutes, which were then mapped to 19 putative cell types. Three different subpopulations of neural stem/pregenitor cells were identified, each primed for different developmental stages.
